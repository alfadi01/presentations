# SNACE Meeting
### 16.10.25 Meeting


---


# **Efficient Coding Control Layer**

**Goal:** Design a control scheme optimizing both task performance and system energy efficiency.

**Active Efficient Coding:** Adapts biases/gains of lower layers via feedback using a Reinforcement Learning Framework and a sparse coding model.

---

# **Predictive Coding**


- Uses a hierarchical network minimizing prediction error.

- Feedforward = residual error / Feedback = prediction.

- Only unexpected information is propagated.

# **Implementation of Neuromorphic PLL**

- Started implementation of SOtA sPLL .

- Mastella, M., Tiemens, T. & Chicca, E. Texture Recognition Using a Biologically Plausible Spiking Phase-Locked Loop Model for Spike Train Frequency Decomposition (2024).

- Planning to study the system robustness to various types of noise.

# **Planning of the SNACE Meeting Discussion**

- Should we prepare something to have some points to discuss during the meeting and make it more productive ?
