# Monday Meeting
### 15.09.25 Meeting

# Chip Layout Continuation

- Layout almost finished
- Deadline is on Friday - after this, no more time invested

# Interesting paper on PRCs

- R. M. Smeal, G. B. Ermentrout, and J. A. White, “Phase-response curves and synchronized neural networks,” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, Aug. 2010, doi: 10.1098/rstb.2009.0292.

- Describes how PRCs can make explicit predictions about whether or not a given network of interconnected neurons will synchronize

# Requirement for applying PRCs

- System must behave as an oscillator: **presence of a stable limit cycle**.
- After a perturbation is induced, the rythm is kept but phase shift.
- When perturbed, the oscillator must return to its natural cycle in one period.
- Synchronization of an oscillator with an external periodic drive requires the oscillator to respond differently depending on the phase at which it is perturbed -> usefulness of PRCs

---

# Networks properties

- After each perturbation, the system should return to its limit cycle before the next perturbation. Useful to predict when and how oscillators can lock into a periodic input.

- If we can assume weak-coupling between oscillators (only perturbs the phase), we can use a phase reduction model.
