# Progress this past week

- Started reading about type III excitability and resonator neurons.

- Resonator neurons act as band-pass filters for periodic signals.

# Progress this past week

- Started reading Izhikevich "Dynamical Systems" book to understand the theory behind type III excitability. 


---

# Progress this past week

- Implemented Loris' model on Brian2 (with simplified sigmoids).
